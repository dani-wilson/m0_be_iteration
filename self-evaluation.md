# Self Evaluation

1. How might the `each` method be useful?
- It will be useful to communicate something to many elements in an array. It will also be useful to eliminate or bring up other desired types of data.

2. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that?
- I need to learn how to do the challenge of how to only print names that begin with a certain letter. I will do more researching and ask my husband, who is a backend developer.

3. What worked well for you in terms of your approach on this
assignment?
- I approached it with a goal to have fun with it and to learn as many new things as I could while still remaining conscious of my time spent... And I can say that I accomplished both things.
